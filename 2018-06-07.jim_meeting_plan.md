## Will almost certainly happen within a year

These are listed in decreasing order of probability of actually happening.

- **Second author**: "Untargeted detection of human health and activity markers in residential wastewater through microbiome sequencing and metabolomics", aiming for PNAS (current status: first draft)      
- **Middle author**: "A Practical Guide to Methods Controlling False Discoveries in Computational Biology", aiming for Genome Biology (current status: finalizing figures for submission)      
- **First author**: "Framework for donor selection in fecal microbiota transplant clinical trials", aiming for a commentary/article hybrid or perspective piece (current status: 20% of a draft)       
- **Second/third author**: 10 location study: residential sewage in the US, Kuwait, and South Korea (current status: active results generation, being led by M.eng student)       
- **First/second/third author**: antimicrobial resistance risk metric across environments (current status: TBD if this will be incorporated into 10 location study)      
- **Second/third author**: meta-analysis of human case-control metabolomics studies (current status: just starting, being led by a very talented rotation student)          

# Project summaries + thesis ideas

My projects are united by two common themes:      

- generating *useful, practical, actionable* knowledge     
- mining large biological datasets (16S, metabolomics, metagenomics)     

They have applications in the the clinical, research, and public health spaces.

1. Aerodigestive microbiome in aspiration: clinical application of microbiome data analysis. (lead author)       
2. Meta-analysis of gut microbiome studies: making sense of existing research. (lead author)       
3. Mining untargeted biological data in sewage: identifying human biomarkers and measuring antimicrobial resistance in sewage. (co-lead of project, but not necessarily lead author on any one paper)        
4. Untargeted metabolomics for blood diagnostics and outcome prediction (student lead of the project, definitely not a primary author on any papers)       

Are these projects a satisfactory thesis?

Do you have thoughts on uniting them into a _thesis_, or are my two vague themes sufficient?

# Post-grad plans

I want to apply personalized medicine methods and philosophies to public health.

- Dream job: Biobot Analytics - tracking opioid epidemic through sewage (broader vision: precision public health by monitoring biomarkers in residential sewage)      
- Academia?
    - _personalized medicine for public health_: sewage-based analyses give better spatial and temporal resolution. Measure individual communities instead of aggregate cities/states.
    - _improve biomarkers through untargeted data_: find better biomarkers through untargeted analyses integrating multiple 'omics. Look at diseases with public health relevance: antimicrobial resistance, infectious disease, lifestyle-associated conditions. Ideally also look for markers that can be harnessed for preventative interventions.      
- Other ideas?

Do I want to keep a postdoc as a plan B? If so, how should I prepare/set myself up for success?
