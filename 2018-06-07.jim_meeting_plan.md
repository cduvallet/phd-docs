Meeting with Jim to discuss wrapping up Claire's PhD.

### Meeting goals

- Your criteria for graduation (and what else I need to meet them)
- Expectations for thesis document
- Advice on career path: postdoc strategy?

# Papers

## Current plan for PhD

- **First author**     
    - "Meta-analysis of gut microbiome studies identifies disease-specific and shared responses," _Nature Communications_ (Dec 2017)        
    - "Altered relationships between gastric, lung, and oropharyngeal microbiomes in patients with aerodigestive symptoms," submitted but rejected       
    - (_opinion piece_): "Meta-analysis generates and prioritizes hypotheses for translational microbiome research," _Microbial biotechnology_ (Jan 2018)      
    - (_perspective piece_): "Framework for donor selection in fecal microbiota transplant clinical trials," in the process of writing      
- **Second author**
    - "Correcting for batch effects in case-control studies," _PLoS Comp Bio_ (April 2018), also wrote associated software (QIIME 2 plugin)
    - "dbOTU3: A new implementation of distribution-based OTU calling," _PLoS ONE_ (May 2017), also wrote associated software (QIIME 2 plugin)
    - "Untargeted detection of human health and activity markers in residential wastewater through microbiome sequencing and metabolomics," first draft written, aiming for PNAS      
- **Middle author**      
    - "A Practical Guide to Methods Controlling False Discoveries in Computational Biology", close to submission, aiming for Genome Biology   
    - 10 location study: residential sewage in the US, Kuwait, and South Korea, current status: active results generation, being led by excellent M.eng student    

## Other potential papers

- **First/second/third author**
    - Antimicrobial resistance risk metric across environments   
    - current status: very early stages, TBD if this will be incorporated into 10 location study or will become its own paper            
- **Second/third author**
    - Meta-analysis of human case-control metabolomics studies    
    - current status: just starting, being led by a very talented rotation student          

# Thesis

My projects are united by two common themes:      

- generating *useful/practical/actionable* knowledge     
- mining large biological datasets (16S, metabolomics, metagenomics)     

They have applications in the the clinical, research, and public health spaces.

1. Aerodigestive microbiome in aspiration: **clinical** application of microbiome data analysis. (lead author)       
2. Meta-analysis of gut microbiome studies: making sense of existing **research**. (lead author)       
3. Mining untargeted biological data in sewage: identifying human biomarkers and measuring antimicrobial resistance in sewage [**public health** relevance]. (co-lead of multiple sub-projects, but not necessarily lead author on any one paper)        
4. Untargeted metabolomics for blood diagnostics and outcome prediction (student lead of the project, definitely not a primary author on any papers)       

Are these projects a satisfactory thesis?

Do you have thoughts on uniting them into a _Thesis_?

# Post-grad plans

**My goal is to apply personalized medicine methods to public health.**

- Personalized medicine methods = big data, multi-omics, and finer resolution of measurements (spatially, temporally).    
- Public health = infectious disease, antimicrobial resistance, lifestyle-associated diseases.

I would prefer to not do academia, and straight-up public health is not the right fit. Companies (for profit or non-profit) which are socially-minded and which work with government entities are exciting!

- Dream job: Biobot Analytics - tracking opioid epidemic through sewage (broader vision: precision public health by monitoring biomarkers in residential sewage)      
- Academia?
    - _personalized medicine for public health_: sewage-based analyses give better spatial and temporal resolution. Measure individual communities instead of aggregate cities/states.
    - _improved biomarkers through untargeted data_: find better biomarkers through untargeted analyses integrating multiple 'omics. Look at diseases with public health relevance: antimicrobial resistance, infectious disease, lifestyle-associated conditions. Ideally also look for markers that can be harnessed for preventative interventions.      
- Other ideas?

Do I want to keep a postdoc as a plan B? If so, how should I prepare/set myself up for success?
