Handout sent to committee in advance of Claire's next committee meeting, which is the plan-to-defend meeting.

## Committee meeting goals

- Agree on a graduation timeline     
    - Discuss what is required of me before we can _set a date_
    - Discuss what is required of me before I can _graduate_
- Decide on thesis content and tentative title        

## Agenda

- Overview of finished and planned work    
- Discuss thesis content and title     
- Career plan updates

# Thesis

My projects are united by two common themes:      

- generating *useful/practical/actionable* knowledge     
- mining large biological datasets (16S, metabolomics, metagenomics)     

They have applications in the the clinical, research, and public health spaces.

1. Aerodigestive microbiome in aspiration: **clinical** application of microbiome data analysis. (lead author)       
2. Meta-analysis of gut microbiome studies: making sense of existing **research**. (lead author)       
3. Mining untargeted biological data in sewage: identifying human biomarkers and measuring antimicrobial resistance in sewage [**public health** relevance]. (co-lead of multiple sub-projects, but not necessarily lead author on any one paper)               

Are these projects a satisfactory thesis? Is there anything missing, are there projects I shouldn't include in the thesis?

Do you have thoughts on uniting them into a _Thesis_?

Other projects I could include:
- Method development to correct for batch effects (second author)    
- Insight derived from meta-analysis can inform clinical trials for FMT (lead author)    
- Preliminary work on mining untargeted metabolomics data for blood diagnostics and outcome prediction (supporting author, but co-lead of the overall project)

# Post-grad plans

**My goal is to apply personalized medicine methods to public health.**

- Personalized medicine methods = big data, multi-omics, and fine temporal and/or spatial resolution.    
- Public health = infectious disease, antimicrobial resistance, lifestyle-associated diseases.

I would prefer to not do academia, and straight-up public health is not the right fit. Companies (for profit or non-profit) which are socially-minded and which work with government entities are exciting!

- Front runner: Biobot Analytics - tracking opioid epidemic through sewage (broader vision: precision public health by monitoring biomarkers in residential sewage)      
- Public health: apply my technical skills in real-life public health contexts?
    - Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) fellowships in bioinformatics, antimicrobial resistance, infectious disease, or environmental public health (USA)
    - Epicentre or Global Health Corps (global health)
- Academia?
    - _personalized medicine for public health_: sewage-based analyses give better spatial and temporal resolution. Measure individual communities instead of aggregate cities/states.
    - _improved biomarkers through untargeted data_: find better biomarkers through untargeted analyses integrating multiple 'omics. Look at diseases with public health relevance: antimicrobial resistance, infectious disease, lifestyle-associated conditions. Ideally also look for markers that can be harnessed for preventative interventions.
