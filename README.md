# PhD

This repo contains some documents that I've made throughout my PhD.

The most important one is my thesis proposal.

I also wrote a few other documents to help me plan out my PhD,
which I mostly used as tools to organize my own thoughts and
set agendas for important check-in meetings.

My thesis will be in a separate repo.

At one point, I used `grip` to view markdown files as pdf.
Now, I use Atom's markdown converter to make beautiful pdf's.
