### Post-doc plan

My proposal: I postdoc for you at 50% time until April, finishing up reviews and writing the underworlds variability paper. I go on at least one sampling trip (to Malaysia), and I attend the Center workshop on data analysis. In April, we decide whether I continue to postdoc for you in Boston and/or Singapore, or if I do something else. Something else could mean just taking the summer off, working for the Global Microbiome Conservancy, ramping up my involvement with Biobot, or another option that has come up in the meantime.

**January**: graduate, finish up my PhD, go to frisbee tournament in Europe  

> **Question**: should I be on the February or June degree list?    
       pro-February: you don't have to pay my tuition for Spring   
       pro-June: I have health insurance until the end of August, regardless of employment

**February-April**: road trip around the US, working 2-3 days per week

- write the multi-omics variability Underworlds paper
- reviews for donor selection paper
- reviews for aspiration paper
- Malaysia trip, maybe others
- come back to NYC for the Center workshop

**May-August**: multiple options, TBD

- continue traveling, not postdoc'ing
- postdoc in Singapore
    - work on global library data analysis projects
    - maybe help with Nepal data analysis
    - sampling trips for global project
    - _main deliverable: papers_
- full-time "GSO" for Global Microbiome Conservancy
    - investigate and develop new models for capacity building in computational biology
    - literature review on best practices for sustained engaged capacity building
    - field trips to host trainings and workshops
    - _main deliverable: curriculum and training materials_
- start ramping up Biobot involvement
    - prepare data organization and information flow
    - develop automated reports and visualizations for cities

**August**: decide on Biobot or Global Microbiome (or something else that's even more awesome that's come up in the meantime)
